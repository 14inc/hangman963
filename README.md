# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

I have learnt how to edit markdowns and design object oriented programs using the Python programming language.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
No installation required. Just zip the project and unzip it on your local machine

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
On your Terminal, run <code>python3 milestone_2.py</code>

Also, run <code>python3 milestone_3.py</code> to see the version of this solution that incorporates the use of Python functions.

Next, run <code>python3 milestone_4.py</code> to see the version of this solution that incorporates the use of Python classes. It also offers more feedback to the user that helps their guessing.

Finally, run <code>python3 milestone_5.py</code> to see the final version of this solution that ties all concepts used together. Please note that it has limitations that makes it run in an infinite loop. This is as a result of the instructions provided in the project guidance.

Feel free to edit the code to remove these limitations
